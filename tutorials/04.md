This tutorial will show you how to monitor the connection to the platform.

### Setting up monitoring

The main `Syncano` object has a `Monitor` property that exposes methods for monitoring the network connection. To set up the monitor, use the `startMonitoring` method:

```
let connection = Syncano();

connection.Monitor.startMonitoring();
```

### Listening for events

The monitor exposes an `EventEmitter` so you can listen for the `connected` and `disconnected` events:

```
connection.Monitor.on('connected', () => {
  // connected to the api
});

connection.Monitor.on('disconnected', (error) => {
  // connection to the api lost
});

```

### Stopping monitoring

To stop monitoring the connection, use the `stopMonitoring` method:

```
connection.Monitor.stopMonitoring();
```
